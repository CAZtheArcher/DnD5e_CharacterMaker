# DnD5e_CharacterMaker
Final Project of IGME 430 (Rich Media Web App Development). a DND 5e character sheet builder, taking you through a step - by - step process of creating a character, adding spells / items, and more.

TO DO:
 + Make API for character Races OR file that it draws from (reference project 1)
 + Impliment Forms to be visible on the webpage
 + create methods for random stat generation (4d6 drop lowest, point buy, & standard array)
  - able to use an array w/ 6 spaces to act as "holders", and use JavaScript to eliminate that as an option for other drobdown buttons.
 + Remove Domo from the Document
